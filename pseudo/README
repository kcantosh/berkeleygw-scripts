Pseudopotentials used in the calculation for FeSe

Cutoff energies are given as suggestions (TB)

Fe.pbe-sp-mt_gipaw.UPF - norm-conserving with semicores and 160 Ry kinetic energy cutoff
Fe.pbe-mt_fhi.UPF - norm-conserving without semicores and 70 Ry kinetic energy cutoff
Se.pbe-hgh.UPF - norm-conserving without semicores and 70 Ry cutoff (or smaller)
